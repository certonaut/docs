# Welcome to certonaut documentation

Certonaut is a Rust‑native ACME (RFC 8555) client and library for fully automated issuance, renewal, and management of X.509 certificates. Supports HTTP-01 and DNS-01 challenges, in a fully guided interactive mode. Features a (Linux-only) eBPF “magic” solver to solve HTTP-01 challenges automatically.

!!! warning

    Certonaut is currently in an alpha state. While basic functionality is there, there are still a lot of unfinished rough edges, bugs, and unstable features. It is currently not recommended to deploy certonaut in production.
